This repository contains the algorithms contained within "Improved methods for finding imaginary quadratic fields with high n-rank". 

The code is written in Sage v 9.2, and each Algorithm is presented as its own function. The best way to understand these functions would be to go over the corresponding algorithms in the paper!
