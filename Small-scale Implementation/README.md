The file "Algorithm 3.2 Improved Alg" contains code for a small scale (one node) implementation of Algorithm 3.2

This would be most suitable to use if one is in need of a handful of examples of discriminants with p-rank > 1. 

More information is given in the file itself, but it can be saved as a .sage file and executed in Sage v9.2. As is, the file runs with parameters 

p=7, lambdas = [(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)], lower_m1 = 3, upper_m1 = 32

as a quick example, but these can (and should) be changed at the bottom of the file.
